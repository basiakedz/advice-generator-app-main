# Advice Generator App created in Vanilla JS ![Green Light Bulb](/images/favicon-32x32.png)

This is one of two “advice generator apps”. Both look the same but this app was created in Vanilla JS and the second one in React (you can find the link here [https://github.com/basiakedz/advice-generator-app_React](https://github.com/basiakedz/advice-generator-app_React) to compare them). Making two similar apps but in different ways allowed me to see the difference between using Vanilla JS and React (which is easier to implement in my opinion).

This app is using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com).
Users can generate a new piece of advice by clicking on the dice icon and save the best quotes in favourite list, so that they can come back to them anytime they want.

The part of the application is based on a ready-made design, while the new functionalities added by me were also designed by me. I placed particular emphasis on ensuring that the new features match the pre-existing style of the application.
